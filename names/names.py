# ---------- Stretch Goal -----------
# Python has built-in tools that allow for a very efficient approach to this problem
# What's the best time you can accomplish?  Thare are no restrictions on techniques or data
# structures, but you may not import any additional libraries that you did not write yourself.

# list comprehension performed search in 1.5 seconds
duplicates = [name for name in names_1 if name in names_2]

# Using sets finished search in 0.0229 seconds which was the fastest overall
# & sign between two sets works the same as set(list1).intersection(list2)
duplicates = set(names_1) & set(names_2)
